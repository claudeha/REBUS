REBUS: about guessing what things are doing what how to play it

explaining strings with ghosts 3 November 2018


This is the initial code for REBUS before it was even called REBUS and it was all dismembered in parts. 
The code was used for a performance at Sonorities in April 2015.

Then progressively modified and used in the very first user study in 2017. 
The original GIT repository was on BitBucket (private) and it was called Spectrifier.
The very first piece of code was written for an assignment as part of a DSP module taught by Andrew McPherson at Queen Mary university of London, Media & Arts Technology DTC >> BSc/PhD.

At that time, REBUS wasn't called REBUS yet, and Bela wasn't called Bela yet, we used to call it Beaglebone Black with Audio Cape, or bbb!


And this is history!
