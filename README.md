REBUS - Electromagnetic Interactions

De rebus quae geruntur...

Rebus is a digital compositional tool and interactive system which radically innovates the 100 years old Theremin technique, generating an electromagnetic field that forms an immaterial interface which can be manipulated by the movement of the hands and the body.

The hardware development started at Queen Mary University of London as part of a PhD in Media & Arts Technology supervised by Professor Clive Parini and Dr Andrew McPherson. REBUS is the result of the very first collaboration between the Anntennas &Electromagnetics Group and C4DM, the Centre for Digital Music. 

The development is currently supported by the Early Career Researcher Fund at Goldsmiths University of London.
